## Requirements

The idea is to have a button tha when you click it loads json from https://code-challenge.azurewebsites.net/api/CodeChallenge and then show it in the overlay.
The data should be grouped by "event" (only those that belong to the same day).
No need to use icons and real photos, focus on the grouping and how to build a [the UI design](notify-UI.png).
